## 🔥 EXAMPLE: AI COLLABORATION IN ACTION

### Scenario: User wants "Add Stripe payments with beautiful UI"

**What Happens:**

```
🎯 GPT-4o (Coordinator): "Task received. I'll handle architecture, 
   Claude will design UI, Gemini will implement. Starting coordination..."

🎨 Claude: "I'm thinking minimalist checkout flow with:
   - Gradient card design
   - Smooth animations
   - Mobile-first
   - Accessibility AAA
   Here's my component structure..."

⚡ Gemini: "Implementation complete:
   - Stripe SDK integrated
   - Webhook handlers created
   - Error handling added
   - Tests passing
   - Code committed to GitHub"

✅ GPT-4o (Synthesis): "Reviewed all work. Everything looks perfect.
   - Architecture: Solid ✓
   - Design: Beautiful ✓
   - Code: Production-ready ✓
   - Security: Verified ✓
   
   Deployed to production. Live at /checkout"
```

**Time:** ~2 minutes  
**Quality:** Better than any single AI  
**Cost:** Shared across APIs
